## Experiment

## 1. Experimenting to find relationships in Dynamixel motor control commands 

from MX-12W datasheet [https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-12w/?fbclid=IwAR2HMHfyoMVUpXsdOFKQmWoarIelAV0Ea9ONx6sfsGAt6oXsIt6a5hGgFXE]

**Motor Control**

In motor command, when the right motor moves forward, it rotates clockwise (CW), and the speed value is positive. When the left motor moves forward, it rotates counterclockwise (CCW), and the speed value is negative. These values can be used as booleans to command the motors. The motors require units in rpm, so commands must be converted from radians per second (rad/s) by multiplying by 60 / (2*pi), or approximately 9.5493.

```
void ROBOT_CONTROL::motorControl(float speedRight, float speedLeft)
{
    // Determine direction of each motor
    bool dirMotorRight = speedRight >= 0; // Right: True Forward CW
    bool dirMotorLeft = !(speedLeft >= 0); // Left: False Forward CCW

    // Control the motors
    Motor.turnWheel(MOTORLEFT, dirMotorLeft, abs(speedLeft *  9.5493));
    Motor.turnWheel(MOTORRIGHT, dirMotorRight, abs(speedRight *  9.5493));
}
```

**Read wheel velocity**

When reading motor values from the Dynamixel MX-12W datasheet, it is found that they can be used in the range of 0 to 2047 (0X7FF) with a unit of 0.916 rpm.

Bits 0-1023 represent counter-clockwise motor operation, while bits 1024-2048 represent clockwise motor operation.

If the left motor moves forward, it rotates counterclockwise (CCW), and if the right motor moves forward, it rotates clockwise (CW). Therefore, when the value exceeds 1024, it needs to be subtracted by 1024 and then multiplied by 0.916 to convert to rpm. After that, the rpm value is converted to radians per second (rad/s) by multiplying it by 2*pi / 60.

```
void ROBOT_CONTROL::readWheelVelocity(float* wheelVel){ 
    wheelVel[0] = Motor.readSpeed(MOTORRIGHT); // Right
    wheelVel[1] = Motor.readSpeed(MOTORLEFT); // Left

    if(wheelVel[0] > 1023){ // Right: Forward CW
        wheelVel[0] = wheelVel[0] - 1024;
    }
    else if(wheelVel[0] <= 1023){ // Right: Backward CCW
        wheelVel[0] = - wheelVel[0];
    }
    if(wheelVel[1] > 1023){ // Left: Backward CW
        wheelVel[1] = - (wheelVel[1] - 1024);
    }
    else if(wheelVel[1] <= 1023){ // Left: Forward CCW
        wheelVel[1] = wheelVel[1];
    }

    // rad/s
    wheelVel[0] = ((wheelVel[0] * 0.916) * 2 * PI) / 60; 
    wheelVel[1] = ((wheelVel[1] * 0.916) * 2 * PI) / 60;
}
```
**Experiment to compared values between the actual wheel velocity and the wheel command**

The motion control was tested using a twist message, computed from the inverse kinematics, yielding a wheel velocity of approximately 2.96 rad/s. Upon observation, it was found that the measured values closely matched the expected ones. Initially, there was a gradual increase in acceleration, followed by a period where the velocity stabilized. Various errors may have occurred during the experiment, stemming from multiple factors such as wheel distance prediction inaccuracies, wheel radius estimation in inverse kinematics, frictional forces, or discrepancies in distance measurement.

## 2. Experimenting to find the relationship between robot's real values and wheel odometry values

## 3. Experimenting to find the relationship between the command (cmd_vel) and the movement of the robot

## 4. Experimenting with movement according to scenarios 1 and 2

The purpose is to observe the movement trajectory of the actual robot compared to the odom frame of the robot obtained from wheel odometry calculations in the RVIZ program

Hypothesis: The movement trajectories may not align due to various factors such as friction forces that cannot be accurately calculated in the program, wheel slip, and other external factors

Two sets of command will be created


### 4.1 regtangle path (via points)

        spent_time = (self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds - self.prev_time_control.nanoseconds)/S_TO_NS
        easy_gain = 1.0

        if (spent_time > 0 and spent_time < 10):
            
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, -0.157 * easy_gain)
        elif (spent_time > 10 and spent_time < 20):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.1 * easy_gain, 0.0)

        elif (spent_time > 20 and spent_time < 30):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, -0.157 * easy_gain)

            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, -0.157 * easy_gain)

        elif (spent_time > 50 and spent_time < 60):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.1 * easy_gain, 0.0)

        elif (spent_time > 60 and spent_time < 70):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, -0.157 * easy_gain)

        elif (spent_time > 70 and spent_time < 80):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.1 * easy_gain, 0.0)

        elif (spent_time > 80 and spent_time < 90):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, -0.157 * easy_gain)

        else:
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, 0.0)

### 4.2 circle path

```
def circle_around_path(self):
        spent_time = (self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds - self.prev_time_control.nanoseconds)/S_TO_NS
        if (spent_time > 0 and spent_time < 1000):
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.5, 0.5)
        else:
            self.publish_robot_twist(0.0, 0.0)
```

https://github.com/HBBEEP/FRA532_EXAM1_6406_6428_6471/assets/75566343/17a5f61e-d245-4abe-b685-1a071f6ed9c0

From the experiment, it can be observed that circular movement can complete a full circle and converge close to the original point, as evidenced by the actual positions and those displayed in the RVIZ program. However, with square movement, it is found that the intended objective cannot be achieved. Specifically, the wheel rotation cannot complete the circle as specified in the designed instructions. This incomplete rotation causes accumulating errors in subsequent rotations. It is hypothesized that several factors contribute to this issue, such as unstable internet signals and delays in sending instruction sets, leading to inconsistencies in timing.
